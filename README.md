# Resume Parser

This project is a simple resume parser that uses the OpenAI GPT-4 model to convert resume text into a structured JSON format. The parser extracts key information such as Name, Title, Education, Technical Skills, Work Experience, Certifications, and Projects.
## Requirements

- Python 3.x
OpenAI Python client library (version 1.35.10 or later)
## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
3. Install the required packages:

python3 -m venv myenv

```sh
pip install openai
```

## Usage

1. Add your OpenAI API key in the script:

```python
openai.api_key = "your-api-key-here"
```

2. Place the resume text in a file named `resume.txt` in the same directory as the script.

3. Run the script:

```sh
python resumeParser.py
```

The parsed JSON output will be printed to the console.
